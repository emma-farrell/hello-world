# hello-world
My first repository
I'm Emma, I'm 40, and I live in Wiltshire with my partner and four-year-old son. Before becoming a mum, we lived in West Berkshire and I spent fourteen years in the IT Services sector working as a 1st and 2nd Line Support Analyst. Once my son was born, I took time out of work to be present during his early years, and we also moved to rural Wiltshire, which has been a revelation. Now that my boy is approaching the start of his school life, I've taken on a little freelance Admin work just to start earning again, and I'm also trying to press on with getting back to work, but I don't want to go back to doing IT Support, and intend to follow my passion of Web Development and continue my freelance career. It's easier said than done with an energetic boy and a busy house to run. 

I'm now 41, still busy working as a Freelance Administrator, and currently working on coding a blog.
